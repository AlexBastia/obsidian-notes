Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

Can be used when there is a need to have multiple families of products, to hide product implementations and present only interfaces.
- Supports consistency among products and makes exchanging product families easy.
- It is very difficult to support new kinds of products in each family.
