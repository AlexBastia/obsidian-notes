## Architecture
[[Superposition]] allows us to generalise the notion of bits with **qbits**, that can be in both states simultaneously. Quantum gates have to follow the dynamics of quantum operations, and some can be reversible. 

## Algorithms
With superposition, it's possible to execute operations over multiple states to achieve massive parallelism. A certain subset of qbits can then be measured to collapse the state and get an answer, using entanglement as well.

## Languages
Allowing quantum algorithms to become concrete software requires quantum languages, that have been already created.

## Theoretical Computer Science
Definition of a quantum Turing machine (generalisation of a Turing machine with quantum states) to classify and relate different ideas, including quantum complexity classes.

## Cryptography
Indeterminacy and superposition are very useful for creating new versions of public key protocols that use the laws of physics to guarantee privacy. 

## Information Theory
Order and information in quantum computing differ from classical notions and can be exploited to achieve
new results in data storage, transmission, and compression.
