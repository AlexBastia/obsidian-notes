Notion that objects are affected only by other objects nearby (in its past light cone), the laws of physics work in a **local** way.

## Non-locality
In quantum mechanics, one can entangle two particles in such a way that a change on one particle can have an effect on the other regardless of their relative distance, thus ignoring the principle of locality.
