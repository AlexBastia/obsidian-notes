Used to create an object when the information needed to build it is available only at run time.
- Can be used when a class cannot anticipate the class of the objects it must create.

In this pattern we can create an interface to create an object and let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
- This pattern connects parallel class hierarchies.
