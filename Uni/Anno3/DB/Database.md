Is used by an [[Information System]].

They are:
- **Big**: their size are (by far) greater than the computing systems’ main memory.
- **Persistent**: their lifetime is independent from the lifetime of the computer processes using such data.
- **Shared**: accessible by the whole corporation or divided into areas with different information (sub)systems.
- **Reliable**: tolerant to both hardware and software failures (using [[Transaction]] handling).
- **Efficient**: in memory and time resources (also a result of software quality).
- **Effective**: provide powerful and flexible functionalities.

Problems:
- **Redundancy**: same data appearing many times.
- **Inconsistency**: different descriptions not matching (caused by redundancy).
- **Permission**: specific mechanisms to manage access to shared data.
- **Concurrency**: manage multiple access of shared data.
