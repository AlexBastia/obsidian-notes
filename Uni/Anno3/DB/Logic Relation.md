Given $D_1,D_2,...,D_n$ ($n$ not necessarily different sets) a **logical relation** over these sets is any set $r$ such that:
$$r \subseteq D_1 \times D_2 \times ... \times D_n$$
Thus, a logical relation $r$ is a set of **ordered tuples** $(d_1,d_2,...,d_n)$ such that $d_1 \in D_1, d_2 \in D_2, ..., d_n \in D_n$.
	Note that:
	- there is no order between the different tuples in a relation
	- all tuples in a relation are distinct
