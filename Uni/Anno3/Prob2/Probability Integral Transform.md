We have a starting funciton of which we take the inverse. We are using the cumulative integral function, thus the "Integral" part.

The PIT can produce any random variable starting from a uniform. Lets say we want a random variable with density $f$ and cdf $F$:
$$
F_X(x) = \int^x_{-\infty} f_X(t)dt
$$
We set $U = F_X(X)$ and solve for $X$. Note that $F_X$ has to be invertible, although this is almost always the case. 

The cdf always (with some exceptions) exists, but the density might not. So the first thing we find is the cumulative, and if it exists we can calc the integral and get the density. 

We use the definition of the generalised inverse:
$$
F^{-1}(u) = inf\{x; F(x) \ge u\}
$$
If $U \~ Unif(0,1)$, then $F_X^{-1}=X$. This only works for the uniform distribution. 

We have that $F_X(x) = P(X \le x) = \int^x_{-\infty} f_X(t)dt$. In general, it's a **monotonic, non-decreasing** function. Outside of weird cases (greater than numerable amount of discontinuous points in $f_X$ i think), it's continuous. 

We can't sample directly from X because we don't know its distribution. But we can select a random value from $F_X(x)$ then find its inverse, but does this truly give the correct distribution? 

The uniform distribution has some cool props:
- $U \~ Unif(a,b) \iff \forall u \in [a,b]. P(U \le u) = F_U(u) = u$

Thus: 
$$P(F^{-1}_X(U) \le x) = P(F_X(F_X^{-1}(U)) \le F_X(x) = P(U \le F_X(x)) = F_X(x)$$

So we can say
$$X = F_X^{-1}(U)$$
