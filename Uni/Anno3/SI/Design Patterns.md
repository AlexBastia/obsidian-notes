> “Descriptions of communicating objects and classes that are customized to solve a general design problem in a particular context.” -- _E. Gamma_

A **Pattern** describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the **core of the solution** to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.
### Description
A pattern has four elements:
- The **pattern name**: used to describe a problem, its solutions and consequences in one or two words.
- The **problem**: describes a particular design problem and its context.
- The **solution**: describes the design elements, their relationships, their responsibilities, and collaborations.
- The **consequences**: results and trade-offs of applying design patterns.
### OO Patterns
**Design objects** are our “bricks”. Informally, a design pattern is a particular “configuration” of design objects.
	That is, a set of objects and their mutual relations (inheritance, composition, aggregation, association, creation, …)
OO design patterns have excellent potentials to be the “right” components for reuse.

### Gamma approach
Gamma distinguishes 3 kinds of patterns:
- **[[Creational Patterns]]**: object creation ([[Builder]], [[Abstract Factory]], [[Factory Method]], [[Prototype]], [[Singleton]])
- **[[Structural Patterns]]**: composition of classes and objects (Decorator, Proxy)
- **[[Behavioral Patterns]]**: objects interactions and sharing of responsibilities (Visitor, Strategy, Chain of Responsibility, Mediator)
