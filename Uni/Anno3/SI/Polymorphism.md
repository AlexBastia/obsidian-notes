Use the *same name* for methods using operations of the *same kind* on different objects (eg. the + operator in maths is used both with Natural numbers and vectors).

There are three different types of polymorphism:
- **Ad-hoc** (or overloading)
-  **Generic** (or parametric)
- **Inheritance** (or overriding)
