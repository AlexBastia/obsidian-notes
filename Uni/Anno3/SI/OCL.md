UML extension (so it's a modeling language -> can't be executed) that permits the semantic definition of stereotypes. 

Not very used irl.

It's a formal language with well defined semantics, it also doesn't permit side effects.

Expressions are strongly typed -> preconditions and postconditions (assert in C(++))

Associations with cardinality 1 are treated as assignments 

### Goal
Describe guard statements (?)
