## Structure
The generic structure of an OO Analysis is as follows:
- extract candidate classes
- establish basic class relationships
- define a class hierarchy
- identify attributes for each class
- specify methods that service the attributes
- indicate how classes/objects are related
- build a behavioral model
- iterate on the first five steps

## Extraction of Classes
Read the textual description of the OO Concept Modelling and extrapolate all the possible elements that can be described with a class.

For each of these classes, create [[Class Diagrams]].
